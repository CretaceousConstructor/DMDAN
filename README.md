# DMDAN
This code repo contains the implementation of DMDAN, the original DRDA code repo is in "https://github.com/zhengqq/DRDA_EEG". I modified some of DRDA's implementation to suit DMDAN's need.

The code uses Tensorflow1.x and python, but you don't have to install Tensorflow1.x. Tensorflow2.x is compatible with Tensorflow1.x, as long as you use some instructions such as 
import tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf.
